**1. Information We Collect**

We do **not** ask users to create accounts, and we do **not** collect any personally identifiable information. All user data, including chats, reflections, and preferences, is stored **locally on your device** and is never transmitted to our servers.

**Anonymous Usage Data**
We may collect anonymous, aggregated usage data to help us understand how features are used so we can improve the app for everyone. This includes but is not limited to information like feature taps, session duration, and general engagement trends. This data cannot be used to identify you.

**2. How We Use Information**

- To improve user experience through anonymous insights
- To analyze usage patterns and feature effectiveness
- To guide product development and refine features

---

**3. Data Security**

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the anonymous data we collect. As user-specific content is stored locally on your device, your privacy is further safeguarded.

**4. Your Choices**

Because Stoic AI does not require user accounts or store personal data on our servers, you maintain full control over your reflections and history. You can clear this data at any time from within the app settings.

You may also opt out of contributing anonymous usage insights in the settings.

**5. Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
